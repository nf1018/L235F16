Hello! My name is Nick, a current freshman at Bard College. I come to Little Annandale from the suburbs of Philly with the intentions of studying sociology with a concentration in experimental humanities. 

While collecting pictures for this project, I wanted to explore my own tenderness and chose pictures, which to me, appeared soft and magical. I like to believe everyone has these qualities of mysticism and magic within him-/her-/themselves -- and that it's not just a trait which died when we decided to no longer be children.
