Hello! My name is Nick, a current freshman at Bard College. I come to Little Annandale from the suburbs of Philly with the intentions of studying sociology with a concentration in experimental humanities.
While collecting pictures for this project, I wanted to explore my own tenderness through the lens mysticicality. I chose pictures, which to me, appeared soft and had a magical quality.
