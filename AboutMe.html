Hello! My name is Nick, a current freshman at Bard College. I come to Little Annandale from the suburbs of Philly with the intentions of studying sociology with a concentration in experimental humanities. 
<br>
While collecting pictures for this project, I wanted to explore how un-fixed my personality is; I wanted to portray this primarily through mythical images because I find their existence both lucid and mysterious. Collecting photos for this project and coding made me think about how much I actually know myself -- maybe because it's harder to represent yourself in pictures (or even in words) -- but it turned out I had trouble collecting a series of pictures to embody and represent myself in.
